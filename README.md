# IT-eksamensprojekt
In this project I would like to use (This list is subject to change.):
- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/)
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

I have used Firebase experimentally earlier, but nothing extensive. I have used neither Flask or Foundation before.

The end goal of this project has yet to be decided, which is probably a poor way to start off a project.

## UPDATE
I have decided to use this project as an opportunity to create a better bot for Slack, to use in our class.

Goals are as follows(More may be added in the future):
- Record emote statistics.
- Web configurable messages on a specific time
- Data visualization

## IDEAS FOR FUNCTIONALITY
- Mememinister at random times
- Pointsystem
- Use points for custom responses
- A "!hvadsiger", that will either evaluate to "Yes", "No" or maybe. This will post images of either thumbs up or down fetched from a database of images submitted through the website.
