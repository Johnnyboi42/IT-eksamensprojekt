# IT-eksamensprojekt
In this project I would like to use (This list is subject to change.):
- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/)
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/)
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)

I have used Firebase experimentally earlier, but nothing extensive. I have used neither Flask or Foundation before.

The end goal of this project has yet to be decided, which is probably a poor way to start off a project.
